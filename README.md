## Overview
The Pomodoro Clock is a timer that splits time into work intervals and break intervals between work intervals. It is based on the pomodoro technique developed by Francesco Cirillo to commonly used to divide tasks for short periods of time in order to perform work productively. 

The clock has each work interval and each break interval set to 25 minutes and 5 minutes respectively. It can be started by pressing the Play button and paused anytime during the session by pressing the Pause button. The work interval and break interval can also be adjusted by using the adjusters below the timer display.
